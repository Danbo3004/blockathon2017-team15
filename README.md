## 8BIT Chain - Loyalty System
This repository contains the Smart Contract integration and a simple demo app which similar to a Mobile application that we tend to build later.

Because we have to prove both `Merchant` and `Customer`, you have to do a little bit manually actions. We will guide you through of this.

The concept is building a `token earning and redemption`, the `Smart Contract` that shipped with this was built for the whole application. You need to prepare an `out-app` action, we simulate it by:
- Browse to the wep app https://blockathon2017-team15.herokuapp.com/
- Open the JS console, enter this command
`addRetailer()` - this will create a transaction to `Smart Contract` that allow a retailer to work with us - issueing `Token` to `end-user`.
